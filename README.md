# Kubernetes AI Prompts Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of prompt-engineered examples for generating Kubernetes manifests using AI tools (e.g., kubectl-ai, ChatGPT, Gemini).  
Each row includes the prompt, description, and link to the resulting manifest.

| NAME | PROMPT | DESCRIPTION | EXAMPLE |
|------|--------|-------------|---------|
| app.yaml | Generate a simple Kubernetes Deployment and Service manifest for an NGINX application. The Deployment should run one replica of the `nginx:latest` container, expose port 80, and the Service should expose it as a ClusterIP on port 80. | Basic example of Deployment + Service for NGINX. | [yaml/app.yaml](yaml/app.yaml) |
| app-livenessProbe.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for an NGINX container with a livenessProbe. The probe should check the root path ("/") on port 80, with an initial delay of 5 seconds and a period of 10 seconds. | Adds a livenessProbe to ensure the container is restarted if unhealthy. | [yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml](yaml/app-livenessProbe.yaml) |
| app-readinessProbe.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for an NGINX container with a readinessProbe. The probe should check the root path ("/") on port 80, with an initial delay of 5 seconds and a period of 10 seconds. | Adds a readinessProbe to control when the pod is marked as ready. | [yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml](yaml/app-readinessProbe.yaml) |
| app-volumeMounts.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes Deployment for an NGINX container that mounts a ConfigMap as a volume at `/usr/share/nginx/html`. The ConfigMap should contain an `index.html` file with a simple "Hello from Volume!" message. | Demonstrates mounting ConfigMap as a volume in a container. | [yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml](yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| app-cronjob.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes CronJob that runs every minute. The container should use the `busybox:latest` image and print "Hello from Kubernetes CronJob" with the current date. | CronJob that runs on schedule and executes a simple shell command. | [yaml/app-cronjob.yaml](yaml/app-cronjob.yaml) |
| app-job.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes Job that runs a single container using `busybox:latest`. The container should print "Hello from Kubernetes Job!" and then exit. Set the restart policy to Never and backoffLimit to 2. | One-off Job execution in Kubernetes. | [yaml/app-job.yaml](yaml/app-job.yaml) |
| app-multicontainer.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes Pod manifest with two containers. The first container should run `nginx:latest` and expose port 80. The second container should be a busybox sidecar that logs "Sidecar logging..." every 10 seconds. | Multi-container Pod with sidecar pattern. | [yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml](yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
| app-resources.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes Deployment for an NGINX container with resource requests and limits. Set requests to 100m CPU and 128Mi memory, and limits to 200m CPU and 256Mi memory. | Demonstrates setting resource requests and limits. | [yaml/app-resources.yaml](yaml/app-resources.yaml) |
| app-secret-env.yaml | Generate a Kubernetes Secret with keys USERNAME=admin and PASSWORD=secret (base64 encoded). Then create a Deployment for an NGINX container that loads these values into environment variables. | Using Secrets as environment variables in a Deployment. | [yaml/app-secret-env.yaml](yaml/app-secret-env.yaml) |
