# Kubernetes AI Prompts Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of AI prompts designed for generating and analyzing Kubernetes manifests. These prompts follow industry best practices for prompt engineering and demonstrate advanced DevOps automation capabilities.

## Portfolio Structure

Each prompt is crafted to generate production-ready Kubernetes manifests with proper YAML formatting, security considerations, and operational best practices.

## Prompt Engineering Principles Applied

- **Clear Role Definition**: Each prompt establishes the AI as a Senior DevOps Engineer
- **Specific Context**: Detailed requirements for Kubernetes environments
- **Structured Output**: YAML formatting with proper indentation and validation
- **Best Practices Integration**: Security, resource management, and operational excellence
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Full lifecycle from basic deployments to complex multi-container setups

Requirements: 1) ConfigMap volume mounted at /etc/config for application configuration, 2) EmptyDir volume at /var/log/app for logs with 1Gi size limit, 3) PersistentVolumeClaim at /app/data for persistent storage, 4) Include ConfigMap with application properties, 5) Add PVC with 5Gi storage request, 6) Configure proper volume permissions and readOnly settings where appropriate. Generate complete YAML manifests with all related resources." | Demonstrates advanced volume management patterns including ConfigMaps, EmptyDir, and persistent storage for stateful applications with proper data persistence strategies. | [yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml](yaml/app-volumeMounts.yaml) |
| CronJobAutomation | "As a Senior DevOps Engineer, create Kubernetes CronJob manifests for scheduled automation tasks. Specifications: 1) Main CronJob running daily at 2:30 AM UTC for cleanup operations, 2) Secondary CronJob for weekly backups on Sundays at 1:00 AM, 3) Configure concurrency policies (Forbid for cleanup, Replace for backups), 4) Set job history limits and resource constraints, 5) Include proper environment variables and command configurations, 6) Add volume mounts for batch processing logs, 7) Configure timeout and retry policies for reliability." | Creates sophisticated scheduled job automation using CronJobs with proper timing, concurrency control, and error handling for reliable batch processing workflows. | [yaml/app-cronjob.yaml](yaml/app-cronjob.yaml) |
| BatchJobProcessing | "As a Senior DevOps Engineer, design Kubernetes Job manifests for batch processing workflows. Requirements: 1) Database migration job with single completion and retry policy, 2) Parallel data import job with 3 completions and 2 parallelism, 3) Configure resource limits and requests for batch workloads, 4) Include secrets for database connections, 5) Add ConfigMap for import data, 6) Set active deadline and TTL for job cleanup, 7) Configure proper restart policies and volume mounts for processing tasks." | Implements robust batch processing solutions using Kubernetes Jobs with parallel execution, resource management, and data handling for ETL and migration workflows. | [yaml/app-job.yaml](yaml/app-job.yaml) |
| MultiContainerPod | "As a Senior DevOps Engineer, create a multi-container pod deployment with sidecar pattern implementation. Specifications: 1) Main application container with Go app, 2) Log forwarding sidecar using Fluent Bit, 3) Metrics collection sidecar with Node Exporter, 4) Init container for database readiness check, 5) Shared volumes between containers for log aggregation, 6) Proper resource allocation for each container, 7) ConfigMaps for sidecar configurations, 8) Service exposing both application and metrics ports." | Demonstrates advanced multi-container patterns using sidecars for cross-cutting concerns like logging, monitoring, and service mesh integration in production environments. | [yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml](yaml/app-multicontainer.yaml) |
